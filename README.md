Base release  	: 28th Jan 2018.

Generic note	:	Frontend - http://localhost:3000/home 
					Backend - http://localhost:8080/charge (used by post method from frontend so don't try to use backend separately)

Important Notes before usage: 
1. This is a demo version only and not a full stripe implementation. 
2. There are few other components in this repo for future purpose and Hasura hub deployment later, please ignore them. 
3. Due to resource availability, only web version is designed and nopt react native one, which will be added later.
					
how to execute:
1.	Install Node software (in windows/linux/any operating system supporting node). Refer to https://nodejs.org  
2.	Open nodejs command prompt 
3.	Create a folder for your project and execute command git init in that folder (assuming git is installed).
4.	Clone this GIT repo completely into your local folder
5.	After cloning successfully, 
	a. Go to folder hello-react\microservices\api\src and do npm install and then npm start.
	b. Go to folder hello-react\microservices\ui\app and do npm install and then npm start
6. Now backend server runs in http://localhost:8080 and frontend runs in http://localhost:3000/home
7.  You are ready now to go to http://localhost:3000/home to chose product and place order (we got only sample products for this demo). When prompted for card detail, pls use test card# 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any end date in future and CVC. We don't recommend to click remember me in the payment form.
8.  Backend Server does log some messages.
